# IMA-204: Biomedical imaging / Knowledge representation
Repository for my work over the 2nd year course IMA-204 at Télécom Paris

This course includes a first part on registration and statistical shape analysis using either metrics based on pixel intensity or points of interest (i.e. landmarks).
The second part introduces the concept of graph and how to use it for matching and segmentation.
The third part provides a brief overview of structural medical imaging, both in terms of acquisition techniques and image processing applications. The students will then be able to test the segmentation methods seen in the previous courses on different types of medical images (dermoscopic, X-ray, NMRI).
